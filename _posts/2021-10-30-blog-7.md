## Hour 17 & 18 - Matrix Algebra & Compositions

Hey everyone and welcome to our blog again! Hope everyone's having fun this Halloween! Today we will learn about the operations we can do with matrices and compostions of linear transformations!

## Hour 17

## Matrix Algebra

We all know what matrices are and they can be added, subtracted and even multiplied! However, there are certain conditions that must be met before you can perform algebraic operations on matrices.

## Adding Matrices

Two matrices can be added with each other. The condition to be satisfied is that both the matrices must have the same dimensions. Each element of one matrix is added to the element in the same position of the other matrix. The result must be a matrix containing the same dimensions.
