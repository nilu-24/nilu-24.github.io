## Hour 19, 20 & 21 - Transformation Inverses & Coordinates

Hello everyone! Hope you all are doing well and welcome back again to the concept blog. Last time we learnt about matrices and matrix algebra. Now, we will explore properties of matrices.

## Hour 18

## Invertible Matrix

A matrix is said to be invertible if it has only one consistent solution. This means that when the matrix is converted in RREF, every column will have one leading one. So, the rank of the matrix will be equal to the number of columns of the matrix.
