## Hour 14,15 & 16 - Image and Kernel

Hello Everyone! Welcome back again to the concept blog and today we're gonna cover something really interesting: Images and Kernel! For any matrix A, the kernel and image are subsets in it's domain and co-domain which are really useful properties of the matrix A!

## Hour 14

## Kernel

The kernel (or null space) of a matrix A, written ker(A), is the set of vectors x with Ax = 0. So, when you multiply the matrix A and any vector x in the ker(A), the result must be the zero vector.

Note that kernel is a subspace and it holds all the properties of a subspace. This means it has a basis. To find the basis of the kernel of a matrix A, we have to solve for matrix A by making it a homogenous system (the outputs must be all zero).

So, the solutions is the basis of the kernel because any vector from the kernel would output the zero vector.

## Image

The image (or column space) of a matrix A, written im(A), is the set of vectors y with y = Ax for some x. So, it is basically all the possible outputs of the function and you can consider this as the range too. It is basically all the possible values of y that can exist, given a valid input vector x such that Ax = y.
