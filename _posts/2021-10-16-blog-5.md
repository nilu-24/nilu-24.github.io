## Hour 9,10 & 11 - Linear Transformations

## Hour 9 

Hey everyone! Welcome to our blog once again! Today we will learn about the concepts of linear transformations.

## Linear Transformations

 We have always seen how functions map one value(input) to another value(output). We can apply the same concept and find out that vectors can also be transformed to different vectors, even belonging to different dimensions too!

As we can see, the 4x1 input vector in R4 got transformed into a 2x1 vector in R2 and the transformation matrix is the matrix A.

## Properties

Not all transformations are linear. Linear transformations have specefic criteria that needs to be fulfilled.

## Preserves Addition

T is said to preserve vector addition if T(x+y) = T(x) + T(y) for all x and y in input dimension.

## Preserves Scalar Multiplication

T is said to preserve scalar multiplication if T(kx) = kT(x) for all x in input dimension and scalar k.

## Transformation Matrix A

We have defined T to be a linear transformation but what is the matrix representation of T? Every linear transformation T can be represented by a matrix A such that Ax = T(x).

The transformations of the basis vectors by T are the columns of the transformation matrix A. This means that the kth column of A is T(ek) where ek is the kth standard basis vector.

## Hour 10

## Geometric Representation of Linear Transformations

The standard basis vectors are really useful in visualising what the transformation T is actually doing.

 Here A is the transformation matrix for T which represents a reflection across the y axis.
 
 ## Projections
 
 The word projection means to cast an object onto something. Similarly vectors can also be
