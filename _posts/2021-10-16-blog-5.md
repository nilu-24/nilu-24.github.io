## Hour 9,10 & 11 - Linear Transformations

## Hour 9 

Hey everyone! Welcome to our blog once again! Today we will learn about the concepts of linear transformations.

## Linear Transformations

 We have always seen how functions map one value(input) to another value(output). We can apply the same concept and find out that vectors can also be transformed to different vectors, even belonging to different dimensions too!

As we can see, the 4x1 input vector in R4 got transformed into a 2x1 vector in R2 and the transformation matrix is the matrix A.
