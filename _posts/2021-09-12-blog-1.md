## Hour 1 & 2 - Introduction to Linear Systems & Gaussian Elimination

Hey everyone! Welcome to our first blog! Firstly, we want to welcome you to MATH 133 and we hope everyone of you will enjoy the learning experience!ðŸ˜ƒ

Now, we all know what linear equations are right? A linear equation is any equation which is in the form **a1x1 + a2x2 +...+ anxn + b = 0**, where **x1, x2,..., xn** are variables and **a1, a2,..., an** and **b** are real numbers. For example, **2x + 7y = 0** is a linear equation.

Now sometimes, we might be interested to find how linear equations **interact** with each other. For example, if you have two linear equations: **2x - 3y = 12** and **-4x + 6y = -24** and you want to know which values of **x** and **y** satisfy both equations, what would you do? 

You can plot a graph of both the lines and find the intersecting point to solve it and yes, that's the **geometric way** of solving it! But we can also treat it as a **system of equations** and use **matrix form** to solve it!

## System of equations

We can treat multiple equations together as a system of equations and put them in a matrix form as shown in the picture below:
