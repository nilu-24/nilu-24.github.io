## Hour 24 & 25 - Distances, Projections, Magnitude, Cross Product & Curve Fitting

Hey everyone! Welcome back again to out linear algebra blog! Hope everyone is doing well! In today's blog we will learn about some very interesting ways linear algerba relates to geometry.

## Hour 24 

## Projections

A vector x can be projected on a line L and and the projection of x on L can be thought of being the shadow of x on the line L, if a light source was directly above x and perpendicular to L.

Here, the projection of x on L is given by the red line and the vector x can be written as the vector sum of Ax + x perp, where A is the transformation matrix which transforms x on L and x perp is the perpendicular component of x.

Here's a formula to find the projection of a vector v on any other vector d.

## Magnitude of a Vector
