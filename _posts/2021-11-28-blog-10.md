## Hour 24 & 25 - Distances, Projections, Magnitude, Cross Product & Curve Fitting

Hey everyone! Welcome back again to out linear algebra blog! Hope everyone is doing well! In today's blog we will learn about some very interesting ways linear algerba relates to geometry.

## Hour 24 

## Projections

A vector x can be projected on a line L and and the projection of x on L can be thought of being the shadow of x on the line L, if a light source was directly above x and perpendicular to L.

Here, the projection of x on L is given by the red line and the vector x can be written as the vector sum of Ax + x perp, where A is the transformation matrix which transforms x on L and x perp is the perpendicular component of x.

Here's a formula to find the projection of a vector v on any other vector d.

## Magnitude of a Vector

We know that vectors have both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of a vector can be said to be the length of the vector.

We can find the length of a vector by taking the sum of the square of all the elements in the vector and then taking the square root of the sum.

## Example of Perpendicular Distance from a Point to a Plane

Here, we have to first find the normal vector (vector perpendicular to the plane) by finding the coefficients of x, y and z. The coefficients are the elements of the normal vector respectively. Then, the projection onto n of QP will give us the vector whose magnitude is the distance we need.
