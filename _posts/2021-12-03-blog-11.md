## Hour 26, 28 & 29 - Orthogonality, Transpose & Determinants

Hey everyone! Welcome to the final blog of this semester. Final exams are knocking at the door and we are sorry that we could not fully cover all the topics in our blog. But the blog will continue to be updated so that future students taking Math 133 can be benefitted too!

## Hour 26
