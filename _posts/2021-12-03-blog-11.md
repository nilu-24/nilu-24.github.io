## Hour 26, 28 & 29 - Orthogonality, Transpose & Determinants

Hey everyone! Welcome to the **final blog of this semester**. Final exams are knocking at the door and we are sorry that we could not fully cover all the topics in our blog. But the blog will continue to be updated so that future students taking Math 133 can be benefitted too!

## Hour 26 

## Transpose

The transpose of a matrix is just another matrix with the rows and columns switched with the original matrix.

If a matrix has dimensions m x n, then its transpose will have dimensions n x m.

## Orthogonality

We have seen and drawn many vectors on graphs and two vectors have a certain angle between them. If two vectors are 90 degrees to each other, they are said to be perpendicular/orthogonal to each other. This means that the dot product of the two vectors must be 0.
