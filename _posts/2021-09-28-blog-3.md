## Spans and Vectors & Linear Independence, Basis and Dimensions 

Hey everyone! Welcome to our third blog. In the last blog, we covered vectors, linear combinations and spans. Let's dive a little deeper now!

## Hour 5

## Span

A span of vectors is defined as all linear combinations of the vectors.

Here, as u2 is a multiple of u1 (u2 = -2u1), u2 itself is a linear combination of u1. Hence, the span(u1,u2) = span(u1).

Here, the paralellogram represents the area covered by the span of the vectors where s and t can be any value between 1 and -1.

Two non-colinear vectors in R3 will span a plane in R3.

## Strategy to Visualise 

In order to visualise the span of vectors and what shape the span might be, you guys can follow the following strategy:

## Hour 6

## Linear Dependency

Now that we learnt about linear combinations of vectors, let's learn about linear independence.
A set of vectors are linearly independent if they have a trivial relation. This means that each vector in the set of vectors must be multiplied by 0 in order for their sum to be 0.

## Linearly Dependent

A set of vectors are linearly dependent if they have a non-trivial relation.

## Linearly Independent

If two vectors are linearly independent, their augmented matrix will have the same number of leading ones as the column of the matrix.
