## Spans and Vectors & Linear Independence, Basis and Dimensions 

Hey everyone! Welcome to our third blog. In the last blog, we covered vectors, linear combinations and spans. Let's dive a little deeper now!

## Hour 5

## Span

A span of vectors is defined as all linear combinations of the vectors.

Here, as u2 is a multiple of u1 (u2 = -2u1), u2 itself is a linear combination of u1. Hence, the span(u1,u2) = span(u1).
